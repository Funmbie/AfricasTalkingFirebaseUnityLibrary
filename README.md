# AfricasTalkingFirebaseUnityLibrary
Hey guys!! So this project is a library that is meant to help Unity3D developers make use of Africa's Talking APIs for payments(checkout and B2C), sms and airtime.

##Usage
Just unzip the SDK in the package folder and drop it into your project.
Add the following to the top of your script to be able to use the available functions

```using AfricasTalkingUnityClass;```

For reference, look at store.cs in the game folder [here](Games/Shoot'emUp/Assets/Scripts/StoreLogic.cs)
All responses are identical to our Africa's Talking C# SDK [here](https://github.com/AfricasTalkingLtd/africastalking.Net)
